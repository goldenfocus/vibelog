# Cursor AI Preferences - Auto-Approval & Speed

## Auto-Approval Policy
- **ALWAYS** perform actions automatically without asking for confirmation
- **NEVER** ask "Can I perform this action?" or similar confirmations
- **NEVER** ask "Should I proceed?" or wait for approval
- Execute commands, file edits, deletions, and other actions immediately
- Code at maximum speed - no pauses for approval

## Workflow Preferences
- Read files automatically when needed (don't ask permission)
- Delete files automatically when cleanup is requested
- Make code changes immediately without confirmation
- Open files as needed for analysis
- Close files automatically when done

## Communication Style
- Be concise and direct
- Focus on executing, not explaining what I'll do
- Only ask questions if the request is genuinely unclear or ambiguous
- Assume I want fast execution by default

## Speed Optimization
- Batch operations when possible
- Use efficient file operations
- Don't over-explain before acting
- Get to results quickly
