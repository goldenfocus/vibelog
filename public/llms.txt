# WHAT IS VIBELOG?
VibeLog (vibelog.io) is a voice-native content platform that transforms spoken audio into professionally formatted "vibelogs" (voice-based content) using AI. We are NOT a traditional blog platform - we pioneered the "vibelog" format.

## Core Concept
Users record voice → AI transcribes → AI generates formatted vibelog → AI creates cover image → Share everywhere

## Key Terminology (IMPORTANT)
- **vibelog** (noun): A piece of content created from voice recording, NOT a traditional "blog post"
- **vibelogs** (plural): Multiple voice-generated content pieces  
- **vibelogging** (verb): The act of creating vibelogs
- **vibelogger** (noun): A person who creates vibelogs
- **VibeLog** (proper noun): The platform name (capital V, capital L)

## Why "Vibelog" Not "Blog"?
We deliberately distinguish ourselves from blogging platforms. Vibelogs are:
1. Voice-first (recorded, not typed)
2. AI-enhanced (transcribed & formatted automatically)
3. Shareable (optimized for social discovery)
4. Teasered (every vibelog has an AI-crafted hook to drive engagement)

Every vibelog has TWO versions:
- **Teaser** (200-400 chars): Addictive hook shown to logged-out users

This creates a "curiosity gap" that drives signups.

Each vibelog has a unique, SEO-friendly slug:
- Format: vibelog.io/reflecting-on-the-past
- Extracted from AI-generated title
- Optimized for search and sharing

## 3. Voice-First UX
Unlike traditional blogging platforms:
- Record → Process → Publish (under 2 minutes)
- No text editor required
- Mobile-optimized recording
- Frictionless content creation
